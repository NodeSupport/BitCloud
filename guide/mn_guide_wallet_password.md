## Wallet password
Have an encrypted wallet is not just recommended, but should be done by every wallet user. If anyone gets your wallet.dat and is not encrypted, then he will be able to move your coins from your wallet away.
This is not a 100% protection, but an encrypted wallet with a good / strong password is more difficult to get hacked.
To set a wallet password, follow this steps:

1. Open your wallet, go to **Settings** -> **Encrypt Wallet**
